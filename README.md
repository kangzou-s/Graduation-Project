# Still ongoing

# Scattered puzzle generator/collector
This is a barebones basis for my graduation project on image processing with Python and OpenCV.


# The main task of this project
Computer vision (CV) becomes a necessary part of many robotic and AI-related applications. CV allows the computer to estimate parameters of the environment in order to adapt or to interact with it. The objective of this project is to help me learn the basic and advanced techniques of image processing and OpenCV library. For that, I implement a program that takes an image of an unsolved jigsaw puzzle as the input and scans it to extract the puzzle pieces, align and categorize them.



# Required package
+ opneCv2
+ numpy
+ matploib


# The main process during the project
+ 03/14 Extract the pieces from a green background
+ 03/25 Change the orientation of pieces to a horizontal and vertical.
+ still doing

# The main problems i have faced
+ Feeling so difficult to study with a tutorial which is all written in English
+ Threshold a picture in a proper method
+ Detect the corners of pieces because they are irregular.
